Pivot is a helper function for quickSort

Let's take the follow ing array,

4   6   1   7   3   2   5

What the pivot function is going to do is this -> consider ^ as the pointer and P as the pivot

4   6   1   7   3   2   5
^
p

it's going to sort the following,

4   1   3   2   6   7   5
^
p

and do the swap and give the following result

2   1   3   4   6   7   5       =>It swapped with the smallest value

Now we'll go through the detailed version of the explanaion

consider the following variables,
i and s(swap variable)

4   6   1   7   3   2   5
^   ^
p   i
s

we have the Pivot point p at the 1st index
we have i to loop through the next item over
we then have another one called swap which is current at the pivot point but will move

4   6   1   7   3   2   5       Here i is moved since 4 < 6 so nothing to do here
^       ^
p       i
s

Now 4 > 1 so we will move the swap variable to the first largest

4   6   1   7   3   2   5
^   ^   ^
p   s   i

Then we will use the swap variable to exchange with the index

4   1   6   7   3   2   5
^   ^   ^
p   s   i

Then i will move to the next item

4   1   6   7   3   2   5   Here i is moved since 4 < 7 so nothing to do here
^   ^       ^
p   s       i

Then i will move to the next item

4   1   6   7   3   2   5
^   ^           ^
p   s           i


Now 4 > 3 so we will move the swap variable to the first largest

4   1   6   7   3   2   5   
^       ^       ^
p       s       i

Then we will use the swap variable to exchange with the index

4   1   3   7   6   2   5   
^       ^       ^
p       s       i

Then i will move to the next item

4   1   3   7   6   2   5   
^       ^           ^
p       s           i


Now 4 > 2 so we will move the swap variable to the first largest

4   1   3   7   6   2   5   
^           ^       ^
p           s       i

Then we will use the swap variable to exchange with the index

4   1   3   2   6   7   5   
^           ^       ^
p           s       i

Then i will move to the next item

4   1   3   2   6   7   5   Here i is moved since 4 < 5 so nothing to do here
^           ^           ^
p           s           i


now the loop is complete so we don't need the i variable now

4   1   3   2   6   7   5
^           ^
p           s


So now the thing we need to do is swap the 2 items and we are done with the pivot variable

2   1   3   4   6   7   5
            ^
            s

Usually we return this array at the end of the function but that is not what we will do here
what we RETURN here is the SWAP VARIABLE

because when we run quickSort sort for the left side array ( 2  1  3 ), we are going to run
with the index of zero through swap - 1

when we run quickSort sort for the right side array ( 6  7  5 ), we are going to run
with the index of swap + 1 through end of the array
