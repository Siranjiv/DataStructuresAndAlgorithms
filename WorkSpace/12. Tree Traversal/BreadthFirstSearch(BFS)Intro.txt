We will use the following to understand BreathFirstSearch(BFS)

  So we start from the top and print values from next row to next giving the order like this

  47 -> 21 -> 76 -> 18 -> 27 -> 52 -> 82


  ---The PheudoCode---

  1) First we are going to have a queue[] and an arrayList called results[]
  2) In the queue[] we are going to store the Nodes
  3) When needed we will deque the value and store it in results[]

  the we repeat 2) and 3) when reading the Tree row by row


  The Process is based on the above Tree


  queue [47]
  results []

  We Will Deque and store the value in results

    queue []
    results [47]

  So from the 47 Node we are going to the left which is the 21 Node
  and we Store that in the Queue

    queue [21]
    results [47]

  and from the 47 to the right we have 76 Node so then we put that to the queue

    queue [21, 76]
    results [47]   

  Now we Deque 21 and put the value in the results

    queue [76]
    results [47, 21]
  
  Now from 21 we check if we have node on left and we do which is 18, So we add that to the Queue

    queue [76, 18]
    results [47, 21]

  Now from 21 we check if we have node on right and we do which is 27, So we add that to the Queue

    queue [76, 18, 27]
    results [47, 21]

  Now we checked left and right of 21, now we can Deque 76

    queue [18, 27]
    results [47, 21, 76] 

  Now from 76 we check if we have node on left and we do which is 52, So we add that to the Queue

    queue [18, 27, 52]
    results [47, 21, 76]

  Now from 76 we check if we have node on right and we do which is 82, So we add that to the Queue

    queue [18, 27, 52, 82]
    results [47, 21, 76]

  Now we checked left and right of 76, now we can Deque 18

    queue [27, 52, 82]
    results [47, 21, 76, 18]

  18 doesn't have anything on the left or the right so we deque 27

    queue [52, 82]
    results [47, 21, 76, 18, 27]

  27 doesn't have anything on the left or the right so we deque 52

    queue [82]
    results [47, 21, 76, 18, 27, 52]

  52 doesn't have anything on the left or the right so we deque 82

    queue []
    results [47, 21, 76, 18, 27, 52, 82]

So now we have all values to the result
