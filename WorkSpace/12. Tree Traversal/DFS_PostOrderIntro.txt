     In post order we start with the root but don't printout the value we just visit the node

     we keep on visiting the left until the end from the root node

     So when we reach 18 node, the 18 node look left and right and then print the value

     18

    then up go a node up where we arrive to the 21 node, then we look right and we have 27 so we go to the 27 node


    So when we reach 27 node, the 27 node look left and right and then print the value

    18 -> 27

    then up go a node up where we arrive to the 21 node, since it went both left and right it will print it's value

    18 -> 27 -> 21


    then up go a node up where we arrive to the 47 node, then we look right and we have 76 so we go to the 76 node

    the 76 node will look left and go to the 52 node

    So when we reach 52 node, the 52 node look left and right and then print the value

    18 -> 27 -> 21 -> 52

    then up go a node up where we arrive to the 76 node, then we look right and we have 82 so we go to the 82 node

    So when we reach 82 node, the 82 node look left and right and then print the value

    18 -> 27 -> 21 -> 52 -> 82

    then up go a node up where we arrive to the 76 node, since it went both left and right it will print it's value

    18 -> 27 -> 21 -> 52 -> 82 -> 76

    then up go a node up where we arrive to the 47 node, since it went both left and right it will print it's value

    18 -> 27 -> 21 -> 52 -> 82 -> 76 -> 47


    So this is the final Result
