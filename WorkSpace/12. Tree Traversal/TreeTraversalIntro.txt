     The above is the traversal of a Binary Search Tree
     traversal-> going to visit each node

     There are ways to visit each node

     Eg:- we can do it row by row 

    So we start from the top and print values from next row to next giving the order like this

    47 -> 21 -> 76 -> 18 -> 27 -> 52 -> 82

    This is an example of Breath First Search (BFS)

    Another method of doing it is from the bottom left node to top node then to right node giving the order like this

    18 -> 21 -> 27 -> 47 -> 52 -> 76 -> 82

    This is an example of Depth First Search (DFS)
