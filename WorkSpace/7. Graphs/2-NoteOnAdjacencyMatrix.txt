The Below Graph is a BiDirectional Graph

            A
          /   \
        E       B
         \     /
          D - C

Below is the table representaion of above graph

    A   B   C   D   E

A   0   1   0   0   1

B   1   0   1   0   0

C   0   1   0   1   0

D   0   0   1   0   1

E   1   0   0   1   0


Horizontal ABCDE represents the actual vertex and vertical ABCDE represents the items it has the edge width
AA, BB, CC, DD, EE represents 0 since the graph is BiDirectional we also have a mirror image  by that 45 degree line of zeros

so of the graph is Directional where A->B then the values will be modified as
BA = 1 to BA= 0

if the Edges are weighted then store the values to the table


            A
      10  /   \ 2
        E       B
       8 \     / 4
          D - C
            6

    A   B   C   D   E

A   0   2   0   0   10

B   2   0   4   0   0

C   0   4   0   6   0

D   0   0   6   0   8

E   10   0   0   8   0
