            A
          /   \
        E       B
         \     /
          D - C

for the graph above to store the adjacenctList an unordered Map is used

key:[Value1,Value2]

{
    "A":["B","E"]
    "B":["A","C"]
    "C":["B","D"]
    "D":["C","E"]
    "E":["A","D"]
}

The unordered Map on the above represents the graph above


---Unordered Sets---
unordered set is like an unordered Map

in unordered map we have something like this
{
    1 : true,
    2 : true,
    3 : true
}
so Unordered Set is similar but it doesn't have value but has the keys
{
    1
    2
    3
}

Like an unordered map lookup(), insert() and delete() are O(1)

Also set doen't have duplicates
and we write the set like this
[1, 2, 3]
