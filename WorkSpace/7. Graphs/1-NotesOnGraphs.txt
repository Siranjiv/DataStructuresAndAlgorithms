--Intro--

The Nodes can be called as vertex(Term used in Graph)
multiple vertex is called Vertices(plural word)

when connecting Vertices the line can be called EDGE(Most Prefered) or
CONNECTION


In Graphs you can have(not always) weighted edges (the number on the EDGE)
Eg:- Can be used in maps app to determine the fast road
Eg2:-Network routing protocol-Better to go in 2 fast line than one slow link


Graphs can be Directional or BiDirectional
Eg1:- when you follow a friend in Social Media then friend follows you back
      then is BiDirectional
Eg2:- when you follow Celebrity but Celebrity doesn't follow you back
      then is Directional
When no arrows are used it can be conidered as BiDirectional


---Extra---
Tree is also a form of a graph but they have the limitation that each node
can only point to two other Nodes

A LinkedList is a form of a tree and tree is a form of a graph so LinkedList
is a form of a Graph with the limitation to point to one other node
