This is how SelectionSort sort Work for the following array of values
* We Switch with the idex of the array
consider (num) as the index of the array

 4   2   6   5   1   3
(0) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)

we start with the first item and get the index with the lowest item in the array

we will put minIndex = 0 putting the 0th index as minIndex
we compare minIndex with the next set of indexes in the array one by one and compare then until we get the shortest valued index

so it will go like this  for the above

minIndex = 1 //since 4>2
then again minIndex = 4  // since 2 > 1

now we swap here, 1 is sorted

 1   2   6   5   4   3
(0) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)

now we look through the 2nd index

minIndex = 1; and we do the same thing
here we leave it as it is since 2 is smaller than the other index values

 1   2   6   5   4   3
(0) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)

now we look through the 3rd index

minIndex = 2
minIndex = 3    // since 6 > 5
minIndex = 4    // since 5 > 4
minIndex = 5    // since 4 > 3

now we 3rd index sorted so we swap 2nd index with 5(minIndex)

 1   2   3   5   4   6
(0) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)

now we look through the 3th index

minIndex = 3
minIndex = 4    // since 5 > 4

now we 3rd index sorted so we swap 3nd index with 4(minIndex)

 1   2   3   4   5   6
(0) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)

and later the other looping will be done but with condition they won't be sorted
