Since we have nested for loop we have O(n^2) => This is the worst Case

let's check a situation like the array below

1   2   4   3   5   6

this array is almost sorted
so the the array will be sorted like this

1   2   4   3   5   6

1   2   4   3   5   6

1   2   3   4   5   6

we check the others as well until the end of the array

so only 1 pass was done so this is n complexity not n^2

The other algorithms are later will be fast but they are not going to fast if they are almost sorted data
