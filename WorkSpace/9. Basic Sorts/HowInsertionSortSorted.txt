This is how Insertion sort Work for the following array of values
* We always start with the second item and compare it with the item before it
if it is less that the item we swap it

4   2   6   5   1   3

//we took the second item(2) and checked with the item before[1st item(4)] 
4 > 2 so we swap
so we get the below output

2   4   6   5   1   3

now we check 3rd item(6) and checked with the item before[2nd item(4)]
so we get the below output
4 > 6 is not true so we don't swap

2   4   6   5   1   3

now we check 4rd item(5) and checked with the item before[3rd item(4)]
so we get the below output
6 > 5 so we swap

2   4   5   6   1   3

Then continuously we check the 3rd item(5) and compare with the 2nd item(4)
4 > 5 is not true so we don't swap

2   4   5   6   1   3

now we check 5rd item(1) and checked with the item before[4th item(6)]
so we get the below output
6 > 1

2   4   5   1   6   3

now we continuously sort the reset with the value 1 (previously 5th item)

2   4   1   5   6   3

2   1   4   5   6   3

1   2   4   5   6   3

now we check 6th item(3) and checked with the item before[5th item(6)]
so we get the below output
6 > 3

1   2   4   5   3   6

ow we continuously sort the reset with the value 3 (previously 6th item)

1   2   4   3   5   6

1   2   3   4   5   6

the loop will check  1 and 2 and that is all the sorting
