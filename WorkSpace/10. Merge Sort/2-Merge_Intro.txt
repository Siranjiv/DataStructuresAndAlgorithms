We will be using a helper function called merge in the mergeSort function

Merge is the function that takes 2 SORTED arrays(Remember that they have to be sorted)
and combines them to one sorted array

let's take the following 2 arrays

    1   3   7   8           2   4   5   6
    ^                       ^
    i                       j

here i iterates throught the first array and j iterates through the second array

here we compare i and j then we find the one with the lowest value and we are going to copy it into a sepearate array

    1

    3   7   8       2   4   5   6
    ^               ^
    i               j


    1   2

    3   7   8       4   5   6
    ^               ^
    i               j


    1   2   3

    7   8           4   5   6
    ^               ^
    i               j


    1   2   3   4

    7   8           5   6
    ^               ^
    i               j


    1   2   3   4   5

    7   8           6
    ^               ^
    i               j


    1   2   3   4   5   6

    7   8           
    ^
    i

we do this until one array is empty so the array j is empty to we will break out of that loop

for the remaining items we will be using a seperate loop

    1   2   3   4   5   6   7

    8           
    ^
    i

    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
