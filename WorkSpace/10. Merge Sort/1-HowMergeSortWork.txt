Merge sort is a sorting algorithum that uses recursion

let's say we have an array below

5   4   7   1   3   2   8   6

the merge sort will take this array and cut it in half

    5   4   7   1             3   2   8   6

then the array will cut in half again

    5   4       7   1       3   2      8   6

we keep doing this until we have single item arrays

    5       4       7       1       3       2       8       6

So single item array are by definition sorted

so then what we can do is combine and sort the single item array all the way across

    4   5       1   7       2   3      6   8

    1   4   5   7             2   3   6   8   

    Then we take the about two and make 1 big sorted array out of these

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8


This is actually a efficient sorting algorithum

*There will be 2 function that we will be using 1 called merge and the other called mergeSort*
