Last note(2-Merge_IntroP1.txt) we had two arrays sorted and then we combine them to 1 big sorted array

So we don't pass the merge function with 2 seperate arrays

We actually pass one array that has 2 sub arrays that are each sorted but it is still on array

for example take 
1   3   7   8   2   4   5   6

1   3   7   8           2   4   5   6

So here we take the sub array on the left and create a new array and copy all the values to the new array
like this   1   3   7   8

We take the sub array in the right and do the same thing
2   4   5   6

when we create new varables i and j. it's with these new arrays that we created


1   3   7   8           2   4   5   6
^                       ^
i                       j

when we compare i and j and take the lower value and put it into a new array, we're actually 
COPYING it INTO THE ORIGINAL ARRAY
